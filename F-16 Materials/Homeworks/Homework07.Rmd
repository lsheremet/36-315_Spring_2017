#  Homework 07:  Shark Attacks!

***General instructions for all assignments***: 

+  Use this file as the template for your submission.  Delete the unnecessary text (e.g. this text, the problem statements, etc).  That said, keep the nicely formatted "Problem 1", "Problem 2", "a.", "b.", etc
+  Upload a single `R` Markdown file (named as:  [AndrewID]-HW07.Rmd -- e.g. "sventura-HW07.Rmd") to the Homework 07 submission section on Blackboard.  You do not need to upload the .html file.
+  The instructor and TAs will run your .Rmd file on their computer.  **If your .Rmd file does not knit on our computers, you will be automatically be deducted 10 points.**
+  Your file should contain the code to answer each question in its own code block.  Your code should produce plots/output that will be automatically embedded in the output (.html) file
+  Each answer must be supported by written statements (unless otherwise specified)
+  Include the name of anyone you collaborated with at the top of the assignment
+  Include the style guide you used below under Problem 0

#  Instructions:  Lab Exam / Homework 07

+  For all lab exam questions, be sure to answer the question(s) asked.
+  In addition to answering the questions, **write 1-3 sentences describing why you made certain choices in your graphic.**  For example, why did you choose a histogram vs. density plot?  Pie chart vs. rose diagram vs. bar chart vs. spine chart?  Stacked vs. side-by-side bar chart?  Why did you choose the bin width / number of bins in your histogram?  Why did you choose the bandwidth and kernel that you picked in your density plot?  Why did you decide to arrange the graphs the way you did (e.g. in a grid, horizontally, vertically).  Etc.
+  Remember, whenever you can supplement your answer with information from a statistical test, this is very beneficial!  Feel free to run statistical tests and include this information as part of your answer.


###  For all problems below, you should justify your answer with a single graph.

Using `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` counts as one graph, while using `grid.arrange()` does not.


###  Reminder:  The problems below differ slightly from what you saw in the pre-test!

#  Data:  Shark Attacks!

Load the shark attack data from the course GitHub page at the following link: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sventura/315-code-and-datasets/master/data/attacks_test.csv] 

The data is taken from Kaggle and was originally compiled by the global shark attack file.  [More information is available here.](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks)


###  Reminder:  The data differs slightly from what you saw in the pre-test!

###  Be sure to update the link from which you download the data in your code!

#  Problem 0

**Style Guide and Table of Contents**

a.  What style guide are you using on this assignment?  (Up to 10 points will be deducted if you do not adhere to a specific style guide.)

b.  Remember to include a floating table of contents in your submission.

c.  Use your theme for all problems.

#  Problem 1

**Victim Blaming?**

Graph:  (10 points)

a.  (4 points)  Characterize the distribution of the `Type` of shark attack.  Describe any interesting features you see.

b.  (3 points)  Compare the different conditional distributions of `Sex` given each `Type` of shark attack.  Are female victims relatively more or less common in any of the shark attack types?  Are unknown-gender victims more or less common in any of the shark attack types?

c.  (5 points)  Write 1-3 sentences describing why you made certain choices in your graphic.

#  Problem 2

**Attacking All Ages**

Graph:  (10 points)

a.  (8 points)  Characterize the distribution of the `Age` of shark attack victims.  Describe any interesting features you see.

b.  (2 points)  Is the distribution of `Age` normally distributed?  Why or why not?

c.  (5 points)  Write 1-3 sentences describing why you made certain choices in your graphic.

#  Problem 3

**Gender Bias?**

Graph:  (10 points)

a.  (8 points)  Is there any association between the `Country` in which the shark attack took place and the gender (`Sex`) of the victim?  Are shark attack victims more or less likely to be female in particular countries compared to others?

b.  (2 points)  Which country has the highest proportion of female victims?

c.  (5 points)  Write 1-3 sentences describing why you made certain choices in your graphic.

#  Problem 7

**Days Are Numbered**

Graph:  (10 points)

a.  (8 points)  Do shark attacks occur more commonly on certain days of the week than others?  Does this change depending on if the shark attack is fatal?  How has this changed over time, since 1850?

b.  (2 points)  Which time spans had the most fatal shark attacks that occured on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays)?

c.  (3 points)  List the different marginal and conditional distributions shown in your graph.  (E.g., write sentences like:  "The conditional distributions of `Age` given each  `Type` is shown in the stacked histogram" or "The marginal distribution of `Sex` can be found by looking at the heights of the main bars in the stacked bar chart" or "The conditional distributions of `Type` given each category of `Sex` can be found by looking at the heights of the cells in the mosaic plot."  Do this for each marginal or conditional distribution shown in your graph.)

d.  (5 points)  Write 1-3 sentences describing why you made certain choices in your graphic.

#  Problem 8

(BONUS:  2 points)

Before Monday's lecture, read the "Lecture 15 R Demo" file on Blackboard, and run all of the code -- including the 3-D scatterplot code.  

You don't have to turn anything in for this problem.  **Everyone will receive bonus credit for this problem if class participation on Monday as at a satisfactory level.**  This means:

+  Asking and answering questions
+  Not being disruptive in class
+  Not starting to gather your things / zip up your bags while there is still time left and the instructor is still speaking / writing / lecturing
