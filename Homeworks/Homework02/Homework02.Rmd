#  Homework 02:  Introduction to `ggplot` and 1-D Categorical Data


***General instructions for all assignments***: 

+  Use this file as the template for your submission.  Delete the unnecessary text (e.g. this text, the problem statements, etc).  That said, keep the nicely formatted "Problem 1", "Problem 2", "a.", "b.", etc
+  Upload a single `R` Markdown file (named as:  [AndrewID]-HW02.Rmd -- e.g. "sventura-HW02.Rmd") to the Homework 02 submission section on Blackboard.  You do not need to upload the .html file.
+  The instructor and TAs will run your .Rmd file on their computers.  **If your .Rmd file does not knit on our computers, you will be automatically be deducted 10 points.**
+  Your file should contain the code to answer each question in its own code block.  Your code should produce plots/output that will be automatically embedded in the output (.html) file
+  Each answer must be supported by written statements (unless otherwise specified)
+  Include the name of anyone you collaborated with at the top of the assignment
+  Include the style guide you used below under Problem 0

#  Problem 1

**`R` Style Guides:  Google vs. Hadley**:  

One important step in facilitating reproducible data analysis is writing easily readable, well-documented code.  To ensure that you do this, you are required (for the rest of the semester) to adhere to one of the following two `R` Style Guides:

Google's `R` Style Guide:  [https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml]

Hadley Wickham's Advanced `R` Style Guide:  [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html]

a.  (9 points)  What are the main differences between these two style guides?  Find at least 5 differences.
b.  (1 point)  Specify which style guide you will be using in this assignment.

Assignments not adhereing to the specified style guide will be docked up to 10 points.

#  Problem 2

**Critiquing Graphs**:

Find a graph from the internet (last 7 days -- e.g. a news article, blog post, etc) or from an academic journal (last 60 days).  Describe and critique your graph using the suggestions below.  In parts (b)-(d), you do not have to address each bullet below -- these are just suggestions of things you can discuss when describing/critiquing your graph.

a.  (5 points)  **Include the graph in your assignment**.  Two choices here:  

+  embed the graph/image in the .html file (see below for instructions) and submit it along with your other files on Blackboard, or 
+  include a link to the graph in your answer to this question.

b.  (5 points)  **Describe the graph**.  

+  What does the graph show?  
+  What variables are plotted on the axes, via color, or via other features of the graph?
+  **What is the main result of the graph?**

c.  (5 points)  **Critique the graph**.

+  Does the graph do a good job of achieving its goals?  
+  Does the graph use an unnecessary amount of data ink?  
+  Does the graph distort the actual effect/data/relationship?  
+  What are the strengths and weaknesses (if any) of the graphic?  
+  What would you change (if anything) about this graphic?

d.  (5 points)  **Critique the caption and/or surrounding text**.  

+  Does the text enhance the user's understanding of the graphic?  
+  What else would you include in the caption/surrounding text to help the viewer understand the graphic?

To include an image from the internet in your `R` Markdown output, use the following code (adjust the width and height as necessary):

(Note:  If you're viewing the .html file, you'll see CMU's logo below; the code to render this image is in the .Rmd file.)

#  Problem 3

**Bar Charts**:  

a.  (1 point)  Load the Twitter / Airline Sentiment data from Lab02.  How many rows does the dataset have?  How many columns does the dataset have?

b.  (5 points)  Create a bar chart of the `airline` variable.  Be that your axes are properly labeled, and that the graph has a proper title.  Make sure that each bar in the graph has the same color.  To do this, use `+ geom_bar(fill = "red", color = "black")`.  Change the `fill` and `color` commands.  What do each of them do?

c.  (4 points)  You can also specify HEX color values when choosing a color, e.g. `fill = "#4169E1"`.  Use a website like [this one](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colorvalues.asp) to pick a color of your choice, and fill the bars with that color.

#  Problem 4

**Spine Charts**:  

Spine Charts are similar to Bar Charts.  We'll cover them in class on Monday.  

With a spine chart, we have a single (vertical) bar and multiple stacked, horizontal bars.  To do this, change the aesthetic arguments in the `aes()` function in `geom_bar()`.  , e.g.:  `aes(x = factor(1), fill = my_variable)`

This will create a single bar on the x-axis (since `factor(1)` creates a one-category categorical variable of length one) and fill the bar in with colors corresponding to whatever categorical values are in `my_variable`.

a.  (4 points)  Re-create the graph from Problem 3, but use a spine chart.  Be sure to correctly label the axes -- remember, their interpretation may have changed from Problem 3.  Include an appropriate title.

b.  (3 points)  In a spine chart, what are the widths of the bars proportional to (if anything)?  What are the heights of the bars proportional to (if anything)?  How is this different from a bar chart?

c.  (3 points)  `ggplot()` allows us to easily flip the orientation of our graphs without changing any of the code.  To do this, you simply have to add `+ coord_flip()` to your existing code.  Do this in a separate code block for the spine chart from part (a), and discuss the differences in the two plots.

d.  (BONUS:  1 point)  Remove the ugly `factor(1)` from the x-axis label, without changing the rest of the graphic.

#  Problem 5

**Rose Diagrams**:  

a.  (4 points)  Re-create the graph from Problem 3, but use a rose diagram.  Be sure to correctly label the axes, if necessary.  Include an appropriate title.

b.  (3 points)  In a rose diagram, what is the radius of each rose petal proportional to?  What does the angle associated with each rose petal correspond to (if anything)?  What is the area of each rose petal proportaional to?

***

#  Problem 6

**Pie Charts**:  

To create a pie chart, use a similar technique to what you used to create a spine chart in Problem 4.

a.  (4 points)  Re-create the graph from Problem 3, but use a pie chart.  Be sure to correctly label the axes, if necessary.  Include an appropriate title.

b.  (3 points)  In a pie chart, what does the radius of each pie slice correspond to (if anything)?  What does the angle associated with each pie slice correspond to (if anything)?

c.  (3 points)  Summarize the differences between a rose diagram and a pie chart in no more than two sentences.

d.  (15 points)  Of the four graphs we used to visualize the `airline` variable, which do you prefer?  Why?  Discuss the strengths (if any) and weaknesses (if any) of each.

#  Problem 7

**Statistical Tests**:

Your friend says to you, "The airlines are all equally likely to be tweeted about."  

You obviously disagree.  You show your friend your graphs from the previous four problems, but your friend is still unconvinced, and wants to know if the differences across the airlines in your graph are statistically significant.  

(5 points)  What kind of statistical test could you use to show that the airlines are not equally likely to be tweeted about?

#  Problem 8

(3 points each)

**Facetting**:

As discussed in class on Wednesday, "facetting" refers to the process of partitioning the original data according to some categorical variable, then creating the same graphic once for each subset.  The resulting graphs are typically displayed in a grid, where each graph is a single "facet" of the full graphic.  

This is a popular way to show how the features of the variable(s) being displayed in a particular graphic can change depending on some other variable.  

With base-`R` graphics, facetting requires you to write a lot of code -- code to do the subsetting, code to display the graphics, etc.  Wtih `ggplot()`, facetting is very easy, as we'll see below.

a.  Recreate the plot from Problem 3, but this time, facet on the `negativereason` variable.  To do this, add `+ facet_wrap(~facetting_variable)` to the existing line of code.  

b.  Adjust the `ncol` or `nrow` arguments in `facet_wrap()`.  How do they affect the way `facet_wrap()` places each facet into a grid of graphs?

c.  Sometimes, it improves our abiliity to compare across graphics if we have all the graphs in a single row or column, rather than having the plots displayed in multiple rows and columns.  Recreate the plot from Problem 3, but this time, facet on the `airline_sentiment` variable using the `facet_grid()` function.  To do this, add `+ facet_grid(~facetting_variable)` to the existing line of code.  

d.  Recreate the graph from part (c), but this time, add `+ facet_grid(facetting_variable~.)` instead.  What changed?  Which version do you prefer for this particular problem?  Why?

e.  We can actually facet on multiple categorical variables at once.  Let's try it.  Recreate the graph from part (d), but this time, facet on both `negativereason` and `airline_sentiment`.  To do this, add `+ facet_grid(negativereason~airline_sentiment)`.

f.  Why are some of the facets in your graph from part (e) empty?  (Hint:  Look at a contingency table of these two variables with `table(airline_tweets$negativereason, airline_tweets$airline_sentiment)`.)
