#  Instructions:  Lab Exam

+  For all lab exam questions, be sure to answer the question(s) asked.
+  In addition to answering the questions, **write 1-3 sentences describing why you made certain choices in your graphic.**  For example, why did you choose a histogram vs. density plot?  Pie chart vs. rose diagram vs. bar chart vs. spine chart?  Stacked vs. side-by-side bar chart?  Why did you choose the bin width / number of bins in your histogram?  Why did you choose the bandwidth and kernel that you picked in your density plot?  Why did you decide to arrange the graphs the way you did (e.g. in a grid, horizontally, vertically).  Etc.
+  Remember, whenever you can supplement your answer with information from a statistical test, this is very beneficial!  Feel free to run statistical tests and include this information as part of your answer.


###  For all problems below, you should justify your answer with a single graph.

Using `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()` counts as one graph, while using `grid.arrange()` does not.


###  Reminder:  The questions and data are altered from the version you originally saw.
